# REBAL

# üéØ **REBAL ‚Äî Rebalancing Execution Token**

## ‚≠êÔ∏è **Overview**

**REBAL** is a Solana smart contract (program) built using the **Anchor framework**. It powers a decentralized, self-custodied index rebalancing system that rewards bots in `$REBAL` tokens when they execute weight adjustments across on-chain digital asset baskets.

It also enables `$REBAL` token stakers to participate in governance by voting on:

- Rebalancing strategies (e.g. periodic, threshold-based)
- Allocation deviation thresholds
- Eligible assets per basket

This program is designed for **real-time index tracking**, **bot execution rewards**, and **community-driven basket configuration**.
This Program was developed in Solana Playground IDE and will be exported for vscode for next version

## üîß **Key Features**

### üó≥ Governance
- **Snapshot voting**: Captures token supply at proposal time to prevent vote manipulation.
- **Vote locking**: Temporarily locks staked tokens in escrow during voting.
- **Quorum enforcement**: Requires a minimum % of staked tokens for a proposal to pass.
- **Proposal expiration**: Ensures proposals are finalized in a timely manner.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Rebalancing Incentives
- **Dynamic rewards**: Higher $REBAL rewards for correcting larger deviations.
- **Cooldown timers**: Prevent bots from spamming rebalances for free tokens.
- **Lamport reimbursements**: Covers transaction fees for approved bots.
- **Slashing**: Reduces rewards if bot action deviates too far from optimal rebalancing range.

### üõ° Security
- **Program-derived mint authority**: Minting $REBAL is only possible via a secure PDA.
- **Whitelist for rebalancers**: Restricts reward eligibility to approved bots (optional).
- **Proposal safety**: Invalid or expired proposals are automatically rejected.

### üß† DevEx & UX
- **Anchor events**: Emits logs for all proposal, vote, and rebalance actions.
- **Named baskets**: Supports multiple indexes, each with metadata and unique config.
- **Typescript test file**: Built-in test setup using Solana Playground's built-in globals.
